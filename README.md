# MY_JAVASCRIPT_PREP
This is a work being performed to prepare for my interviews 

I started to learn java script on my own from udacity.com on 4/12/2017. I think this might help me learn Git too. Initially I started to learn few concepts about scope but I figured it out that I have to be a pro in Java Script to understand scopes. Hence I started to learn basics. Hope this might help me as well as whome so ever viewing this repository to learn JS in a simple fashion.
